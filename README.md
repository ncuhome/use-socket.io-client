# Socket-io Hooks

a single instance socket-io hooks lib for react components

## Why

Since most scene of socket-io are single instance, why not directly provide a react lib based entirely on a single socket instance.

## Roadmap

- [x] lazy Connect
- [x] add connect hooks params
- [x] state store (get Event linked state)
- [ ] resolve that snowpack of example doesn't loaded the latest build file
- [ ] more hooks (use On / Off Any, useEncryptEmit)
- [ ] expose socket context
- [ ] muti nsp (opinion)
- [ ] release 1.0 and OC
